Stretch balloon around the neck of the container careful not to spill any baking soda into container.
When ready tilt the balloon up to dump the baking soda into the container and watch the balloon inflate.


## Talking Points

- remember the carbon dioxide gas that was pressed into the drink at the factory
- remember the word "pressure" from the last STEM lesson.
- pressure made the club soda bottle tight. pressure inflates a balloon.
- we can make our own CO2
- the carbon dioxide was forced into the drink using a mechanical method. we will make a chemical reaction.
- vinegar is acetic acid. used in salad dressing, pickles and household cleaners.  C2H4O2
- baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. used in baking. NaHCO3
- when these two chemicals react they create CO2
- we can see this when baked goods rise by reacting with the acidic ingredients to make CO2 which forms little bubbles
