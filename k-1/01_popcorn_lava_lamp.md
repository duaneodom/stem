## Talking Points
- what differences do you notice from water when you drink coke/sprite/etc?
- ever heard them called carbonated drinks?
- it is because carbon dioxide gas is pressed into the drink at the factory.
- we breath in oxygen for energy and we exhale carbon dioxide. plants breathe in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen
- chemical formula is CO2. carbon "di"oxide. "di" means 2. O-C-O
- open the bottle and the pressure is released which allows the CO2 to start escaping
- remember the word "pressure" for the next STEM lesson
- bubbles rise just like when you blow bubbles underwater
- popcorn kernels are heavier than water so they sink. show popcorn kernel in water.
- escaping CO2 clings to the popcorn kernels which floats them to the top
- at the surface, the CO2 escapes into the air and the popcorn kernel sinks again
- process repeats
