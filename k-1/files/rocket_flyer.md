## Materials

You will need either an antacid tablet (eg. alka-seltzer) and water or baking soda and vinegar.

## Instructions

1. Either crush an antacid tablet into small pieces or use baking soda.
2. Load a small amount (less than 1/4 teaspoon) of the chosen powder into the chamber on the
    end of the plunger and hold the plunger chamber side down.
3. If you are using antacid, pour 1-2 ml of water into the rocket body. If
    you are using baking soda, pour 1-2 ml of vinegar into the rocket body.
4. Insert the plunger into the rocket body maintaining it's current orientation as to not spill
    any of the powder into the liquid.

5. When ready, tip the rocket over, stand it up on a hard, stable surface (table/floor) and back away.
6. In 4 to 10 seconds the pressure should build and the rocket will pop off the plunger with enough
    force to likely hit the ceiling.
